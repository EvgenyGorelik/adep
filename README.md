# ADEP-FRAP

Automated Data Evaluation Program for FRAP Experiments
## Requirements
MATLAB R2018b, MATLAB AppDesigner. (For imgaussfilt() function Image Processing Toolbox is required)

## Usage
For evaluating the experiments the folder containing FRAP images, a unique string contained in the names of the pre-bleach image files and a unique string contained in the names of the post-bleach image file has to be entered. As default, the evaluation results will be stored in "C:\\Users\\*username*\\Documents\\ADEP_for_FRAP". To change the evaluation parameters go to "Settings\\Properties" in the program. For further information see the [user guide](https://github.com/EvgenyGorelik/adep/blob/main/batch/resources/userguide.pdf).
